## Overview of the project

### Project: Library Management System Using Java Programming

### Overview 

This project involves creating a comprehensive Library Management System using Java. The system manages various library resources such as books, magazines, and DVDs. It supports functionalities like adding new items, checking out and returning items, managing overdue fines, and searching for items by title, author, or category. Additionally, it includes features for different user roles (e.g., librarian, patron) and ensures data persistence using file handling.

### Introduction

In today's digital age, managing library resources efficiently is crucial for providing a seamless experience for both librarians and patrons. This project aims to develop a robust Library Management System that streamlines the management of library resources and facilitates easy access to information. By implementing various functionalities and ensuring data persistence, this system will enhance the overall efficiency of library operations.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly Library Management System that allows librarians and patrons to manage and access library resources efficiently. The system will provide functionalities for adding new items, checking out and returning items, managing overdue fines, and searching for items. Additionally, the system will ensure data persistence using file handling techniques.

### Key Activities and Technologies Used

#### Key Activities

##### Requirement Analysis: Understanding the requirements for managing library resources and defining the scope of the project.
##### Design: Creating the design for the system, including class diagrams and flowcharts.
##### Implementation: Developing the system using Java and implementing various functionalities.
##### Testing: Testing the system to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly.
##### Deployment: Deploying the system and making it available for use by librarians and patrons.
##### Maintenance: Providing ongoing support and maintenance for the system.

### Technologies Used

##### Data Persistence: File handling using ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream
##### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implementing OOP principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase

### About This Task

This task involves developing a Library Management System that can handle various operations related to managing library resources. The system will include the following functionalities:

##### Adding New Items: The system will allow librarians to add new items to the library, such as books, magazines, and DVDs.
##### Checking Out Items: Patrons will be able to check out items from the library by specifying the title and due date.
##### Returning Items: Patrons will be able to return items to the library, and the system will update the status of the items accordingly.
##### Managing Overdue Fines: The system will keep track of overdue items and calculate fines based on the due date.
##### Searching for Items: Users will be able to search for items by title, author, or category.
##### Data Persistence: The system will save and load library items using file handling to ensure data persistence.
